# Face Recognition App

A Flask-based web application for face recognition in videos and photos. It detects the first appearance of known persons in a video using binary search and identifies photos containing known faces.

- **Photo Matching**: Upload reference images and a folder of photos to find photos containing known persons.
- **Clear Data**: Reset all uploaded and generated files.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8â€“3.11
- Git
- A video file (e.g., MP4) for default video processing (not included in repo due to size).
